# Developer Guide

Golang version: `1.17`
Kubernetes version: `1.21.0`

## Prerequisites

First finish the prerequisites specified in the [QuickStart](https://submarine.apache.org/docs/next/gettingStarted/quickstart) section on the submarine website. Prepare a minikube cluster with Istio installed. Prepare namespaces `submarine-user-test` and `submarine-cloud-v3-system` and label them `istio-injection=enabled`.

Verify with kubectl:

```bash
$ kubectl get namespace --show-labels
NAME                        STATUS   AGE    LABELS
istio-system                Active   7d8h   kubernetes.io/metadata.name=istio-system
submarine-user-test         Active   27h    istio-injection=enabled,kubernetes.io/metadata.name=submarine-user-test
submarine-cloud-v3-system   Active   27h    istio-injection=enabled,kubernetes.io/metadata.name=submarine-submarine-cloud-v3-system

$ kubectl get pod -n istio-system
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-ingressgateway-77968dbd74-wq4vb   1/1     Running   1          7d4h
istiod-699b647f8b-nx9rt                 1/1     Running   2          7d4h
```

## Run operator out-of-cluster

Before running submarine operator, install submarine dependencies with helm. `--set dev=true` option will not install the operator deployment to the cluster.

```bash
helm install --set dev=true submarine ../helm-charts/submarine/ -n submarine-cloud-v3-system
```

Now we run the submarine operator.

```bash
# Step1: Apply the submarine CRD.
# Note that the submarine CRD /helm-charts/submarine/crds/crd.yaml is for submarine-cloud-v2.
# This step will overwrite it with a CRD generated with controller-gen.
make install

# Step2: Run the operator in a terminal.
make run

# Step3: Deploy a submarine.
kubectl apply -n submarine-user-test -f config/samples/_v1alpha1_submarine.yaml
```

If you follow the above steps, you can view the submarine workbench via the same approach specified in the [QuickStart](https://submarine.apache.org/docs/next/gettingStarted/quickstart) section on the submarine website.


```bash
# Step4: Cleanup submarine.
kubectl delete -n submarine-user-test submarine example-submarine

# Step5: Cleanup operator.
# Just close the running process at Step2.

# Step6: Delete the submarine CRD.
make uninstall
```

## Run operator in-cluster

Note that running `make deploy` `make undeploy` creates and deletes `submarine-cloud-v3-system` respectively. Therefore we will run `helm uninstall` before `make undeploy`.

```bash
# Step1: Build the docker image.
eval $(minikube docker-env)
make docker-build
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)

# Step2: Install submarine dependencies with Helm
# If the namespace submarine-cloud-v3-system doesn't exist yet,
# running Step3 will create it.
# However, note that if podSecurityPolicy is enabled,
# the submarine operator pod will not be permitted until running this
helm install --set dev=true submarine ../helm-charts/submarine/ -n submarine-cloud-v3-system

# Step3: Deploy the operator.
# 1) Note that the submarine CRD /helm-charts/submarine/crds/crd.yaml is for submarine-cloud-v2.
#    This step will overwrite it with a CRD generated with controller-gen.
# 2) A new namespace is created with name submarine-cloud-v3-system, and will be used for the deployment.
#    If such a namespace already exists, this step will overwrite its spec.
# 3) Other resources are created in this namespaces
make deploy

# Step4: Verify the operator is up and running.
kubectl get deployment -n submarine-cloud-v3-system

# Step5: Deploy a submarine.
kubectl apply -n submarine-user-test -f config/samples/_v1alpha1_submarine.yaml

# You can now view the submarine workbench

# Step6: Cleanup submarine.
kubectl delete -n submarine-user-test submarine example-submarine

# Step7: Cleanup submarine dependencies.
helm uninstall submarine -n submarine-cloud-v3-system

# Step8: Cleanup operator.
# Note that this step deletes the namespace submarine-cloud-v3-system
make undeploy
```

### Installing Helm in a different namespace

By default, the Istio virtual service created by the operator binds to the Istio gateway `submarine-cloud-v3-system/submarine-gateway`, which should be installed in the `submarine-cloud-v3-system` namespace via Helm. If `helm install` is run with `-n <your_namespace>`, edit the spec `spec.gateways` of the virtual service to be `<your_namespace>/submarine-gateway` manually once it's created by the operator.

### Rebuild Operator Image

When running operator in-cluster, we need to rebuild the operator image for changes to take effect.

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
make docker-build
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```

## Coding Style

For `go` files, please use [gofmt](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/gofmt/) to format the code.

For `yaml` files, please use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code.

## Generate API

Steps to modify custom resource definition (CRD):
1. Modify the Submarine type in `api/v1alpha1/submarine_types.go`.
2. Run `make generate` to update `api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go`.
3. Run `make manifests` to update crd file `config/crd/bases/submarine.apache.org_submarines.yaml`.
4. Modify the sample submarine `config/samples/_v1alpha1_submarine`.

One can add [marker comments](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers.html) in Go code to control the manifests generation.

## Add resource

Steps to add new resource created and controlled by the operator:
1. Add or modify yaml files under `artifacts/`.
2. Modify `createSubmarine` in `contorllers/submarine_controller.go` to create resource from yaml files.
3. If needed, modify reconcile logic in `contorllers/submarine_controller.go`.
4. If needed, import new scheme in `main.go`.
5. If there are new resource types, add RBAC marker comments in `contorllers/submarine_controller.go`.
6. Run `make manifests` to update cluster role rules in `config/rbac/role.yaml`.

## Run Operator End-to-end Tests

Have the submarine operator running in-cluster or out-of-cluster before running `make test`. For verbose mode, instead run `go test ./controllers/ -v -ginkgo.v`, which outputs anything written to `GinkgoWriter` to stdout.
