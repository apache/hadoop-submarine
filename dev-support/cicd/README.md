# Introduction
This cicd directory contains several scripts to ease code and release management.

## Merge PRs From Github
The "merge_submarine_pr.py" script is usd for merge PRs without access the github web portal. It can also automatically merge activities from github to apache Jira.

As a committer, you should create a dedicated directory to do below steps instead of using existing development repo. Doing below steps in a Docker container with python2 and jira (pip install jira) is preferred:

1. git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop-submarine.git
2. cd hadoop-submarine
3. git remote rename origin apache
4. git remote add apache-github https://github.com/apache/hadoop-submarine.git
5. git config --local --add user.name {name}
6. git config --local --add user.email {username}@apache.org
7. echo -e "JIRA_USERNAME={jira_username}\nJIRA_PASSWORD={jira_password}" >> ~/.bashrc
8. source ~/.bashrc
9. dev-support/cicd/merge_submarine_pr.py
