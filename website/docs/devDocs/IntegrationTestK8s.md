## Introduction

* It checks the API on each page works correctly.

* You can run the test-k8s either locally or on GitHub Actions.
  * Before running the test-k8s, the minikube (KinD) cluster must be created. 
  * Then, compile and package the submarine project in `submarine-dist` directory for building a docker image. 
  * Otherwise, the 8080 port in submarine-traefik should be forward. 
  * Finally, the test case under the `test-k8s` directory is ready to run.

## Run k8s test locally

1. Ensure you have setup the KinD cluster or minikube cluster. If you haven't, follow this [`minikube tutorial`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

2. Build the submarine from source and upgrade the server pod through this [`guide`](./Development/#build-from-source)

3. Forward port

  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 service/submarine-traefik 8080:80
  ```

4. Execute the test command

  ```bash
  mvn verify -DskipRat -pl :submarine-test-k8s -Phadoop-2.9 -B
  ```

## Run k8s test in GitHub Actions

Each time a code is submitted, GitHub Actions is automatically triggered for testing.
