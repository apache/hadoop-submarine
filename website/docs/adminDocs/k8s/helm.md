## Deploy Submarine Using Helm Chart (Recommended)

Submarine's Helm Chart will deploy Submarine Server, TF/PyTorch Operator, Notebook controller
and Traefik. We use the TF/PyTorch operator to run tf/pytorch job, the notebook controller to
manage jupyter notebook and Traefik as reverse-proxy.


### Install Helm

Helm v3 is minimum requirement.
See here for installation: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

### Install Submarine

The Submarine helm charts is released with the source code for now.
Please go to `http://submarine.apache.org/download.html` to download

- Install Helm charts from source code
```bash
cd <PathTo>/submarine
helm install submarine ./helm-charts/submarine
```
This will install submarine in the "default" namespace.
The images are from Docker hub `apache/submarine`. See `./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml` for more details

If we'd like use a different namespace like "submarine"
```bash
kubectl create namespace submarine
helm install submarine ./helm-charts/submarine -n submarine
```

> Note that if you encounter below issue when installation:
```bash
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists.
Unable to continue with install: existing resource conflict: namespace: , name: podgroups.scheduling.incubator.k8s.io, existing_kind: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=CustomResourceDefinition, new_kind: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=CustomResourceDefinition
```
It might be caused by the previous installed submarine charts. Fix it by running:
```bash
kubectl delete crd/tfjobs.kubeflow.org && kubectl delete crd/podgroups.scheduling.incubator.k8s.io && kubectl delete crd/pytorchjobs.kubeflow.org
```

- Verify installation

Once you got it installed, check with below commands and you should see similar outputs:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

```bash
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

### Configure volume type
Submarine can support various [volume types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs), currently including hostPath (default) and NFS. It can be easily configured in the `./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml`, or you can override the default values in `values.yaml` by [helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/).

#### hostPath
- In hostPath, you can store data directly in your node.
- Usage:
  1. Configure setting in `./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml`.
  2. To enable hostPath storage, set `.storage.type` to `host`.
  3. To set the root path for your storage, set `.storage.host.root` to `<any-path>`
- Example:
  ```yaml
  # ./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml
  storage:
    type: host
    host:
      root: /tmp
  ```


#### NFS (Network File System)
- In NFS, it allows multiple clients to access a shared space.
- Prerequisite:
  1. A pre-existing NFS server. You have two options.
      1. Create NFS server
          ```bash
          kubectl create -f ./dev-support/nfs-server/nfs-server.yaml
          ```
          It will create a nfs-server pod in kubernetes cluster, and expose nfs-server ip at `10.96.0.2`
      2. Use your own NFS server
  2. Install NFS dependencies in your nodes
      - Ubuntu
          ```bash
          apt-get install -y nfs-common
          ```
      - CentOS
          ```bash
          yum install nfs-util
          ```
- Usage:
  1. Configure setting in `./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml`.
  2. To enable NFS storage, set `.storage.type` to `nfs`.
  3. To set the ip for NFS server, set `.storage.nfs.ip` to `<any-ip>`
- Example:
  ```yaml
  # ./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml
  storage:
    type: nfs
    nfs:
      ip: 10.96.0.2
  ```
### Access to Submarine Server
Submarine server by default expose 8080 port within K8s cluster. After Submarine v0.5
uses Traefik as reverse-proxy by default. If you don't want to
use Traefik, you can modify below value to ***false*** in `./helm-charts/submarine/values.yaml`.
```yaml
# Use Traefik by default
traefik:
  enabled: true
```

To access the server from outside of the cluster, we use Traefik ingress controller and
NodePort for external access.\
Please refer to `./helm-charts/submarine/charts/traefik/values.yaml` and [Traefik docs](https://docs.traefik.io/)
for more details if you want to customize the default value for Traefik.


*Notice:*
If you use `kind` to run local Kubernetes cluster,
please refer to this [docs](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#extra-port-mappings)
and set the configuration "extraPortMappings" when creating the k8s cluster.

```
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 32080
    hostPort: [the port you want to access]
```


```
# Use nodePort and Traefik ingress controller by default.
# To access the submarine server, open the following URL in your browser.
http://127.0.0.1:32080
```


If minikube is installed, use the following command to find the URL to the Submarine server.
```
$ minikube service submarine-traefik --url
```


### Uninstall Submarine
```bash
helm delete submarine
```
