This page provides general Python development guidelines and source build instructions

### Prerequisites

This is required for developing & testing changes, we recommend installing pysubmarine
in its own conda environment by running the following

```bash
conda create --name submarine-dev python=3.6
conda activate submarine-dev

# lint-requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt are in ./submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/github-actions
pip install -r lint-requirements.txt
pip install -r test-requirements.txt

# Installs pysubmarine from current checkout
pip install ./submarine-sdk/pysubmarine
```

### PySubmarine Docker

We also use docker to provide build environments for CI, development,
generate python sdk from swagger.

```bash
./run-pysubmarine-ci.sh
```

The script does the following things:

- Start an interactive bash session
- Mount submarine directory to /workspace and set it as home
- Switch user to be the same user that calls the `run-pysubmarine-ci.sh`

### Coding Style

- Use [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format Python code
- yapf style is configured in `.style.yapf` file
- To autoformat code

```bash
./submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/github-actions/auto-format.sh
```

- Verify linter pass before submitting a pull request by running:

```bash
./submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/github-actions/lint.sh
```

### Unit Testing

We are using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to develop our unit test suite.
After building the project (see below) you can run its unit tests like so:

```bash
cd submarine-sdk/pysubmarine
```

- Run unit test

```shell script
pytest --cov=submarine -vs -m "not e2e"
```

- Run integration test

```shell script
pytest --cov=submarine -vs -m "e2e"
```

> Before run this command in local, you should make sure the submarine server is running.

### Generate python SDK from swagger

We use [open-api generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/#jar)
to generate pysubmarine client API that used to communicate with submarine server.

If change below files, please run `./dev-support/pysubmarine/gen-sdk.sh`
to generate latest version of SDK.

- [Bootstrap.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/Bootstrap.java)
- [ExperimentRestApi.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/rest/ExperimentRestApi.java)

### Model Management Model Development

For local development, we can access cluster's service easily thanks to [telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/).
To elaborate, we can develop the sdk in local but can reach out to mlflow server by proxy.

1. Install telepresence follow [the instruction](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/install).
2. Start proxy pod

```
telepresence --new-deployment submarine-dev
```

3. You can develop as if in the cluster.

### Upload package to PyPi

For Apache Submarine committer and PMCs to do a new release.

1. Change the version from 0.x.x-SNAPSHOT to 0.x.x
   in [setup.py](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/setup.py)
2. Install Python packages

```bash
cd submarine-sdk/pysubmarine
pip install -r github-actions/pypi-requirements.txt
```

3. Compiling Your Package

It will create `build`, `dist`, and `project.egg.info`
in your local directory

```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

4. Upload python package to TestPyPI for testing

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

5. Upload python package to PyPi

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```
