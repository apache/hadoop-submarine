# Developer Guide

## Coding Style

For `go` files, please use [gofmt](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/gofmt/) to format the code.

For `yaml` files, please use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code.

## Generate API

**Important**: You **MUST** put this repository in a folder named `github.com/apache/`, otherwise, the code will be generated into the wrong folder. Therefore, the full path of this `developer-guide.md` should be like `SOMEWHERE_IN_FILESYSTEM/github.com/apache/submarine/submarine-cloud-v2/docs/developer-guide.md`.

We use [code-generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator) to generate a typed client, informers, listers and deep-copy functions.

Everytime when you change the codes in `submarine-cloud-v2/pkg/apis`, you must run `make api` to re-generate the API.

## Add New Dependencies

```bash
# Step1: Add the dependency to go.mod
go get ${new_dependency} # Example: go get k8s.io/code-generator

# Step2: Download the dependency to vendor/
go mod vendor
```

## Run Operator End-to-end Tests

Reference: [spark-on-k8s-operator e2e test](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/tree/master/test/e2e)

```bash
# Step1: Build image "submarine-operator" to minikube's Docker 
eval $(minikube docker-env)
make image

# Step2: Run Tests
## one can add -v to see additional logs
go test ./test/e2e
```

## Run Frontend End-to-end Tests

Use the following helper script to run frontend E2E tests.

```bash
# Prerequisite: Make sure Workbench is running on $URL:$WORKBENCH_PORT.
./hack/run_frontend_e2e.sh [testcase]
```

- `[testcase]`: Check the directory [integration](../../submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration/).

Example:

```bash
./hack/run_frontend_e2e.sh loginIT
```

## Rebuild Operator Image

When running operator in-cluster by Helm, we need to rebuild the operator image for changes to take effect.

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
make image
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)

# Update the operator pod
helm upgrade submarine-operator ./helm-charts/submarine-operator
```

## Rebuild Images for Other Components

Use the following helper script to build images and update the images used by running pods.

```bash
./hack/build_image.sh [all|server|database|jupyter|jupyter-gpu|mlflow]
```

Examples:

```bash
./hack/build_image.sh all     # build all images
./hack/build_image.sh server  # only build the server image
```
