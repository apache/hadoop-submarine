# Deploy Tensorflow Operator on Kubernetes

## TFJob
We support Tensorflow job on kubernetes by using the tf-operator as a runtime. For more info about tf-operator see [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator).

### Deploy tf-operator
> If you don't have the `submarine` namespace on your K8s cluster, you should create it first. Run command: `kubectl create namespace submarine`

Running the follow commands:
```
kubectl apply -f ./dev-support/k8s/tfjob/crd.yaml
kubectl kustomize ./dev-support/k8s/tfjob/operator | kubectl apply -f -
```

> Since K8s 1.14, Kubectl also supports the management of Kubernetes objects using a kustomization file. For more info see [kustomization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/)

Default namespace is `submarine`, if you want to modify the namespace, please modify `./dev-support/k8s/tfjob/operator/kustomization.yaml`, such as modify `${NAMESPACE}` as below:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: ${NAMESPACE}
resources:
- cluster-role-binding.yaml
- cluster-role.yaml
- deployment.yaml
- service-account.yaml
- service.yaml
commonLabels:
  kustomize.component: tf-job-operator
images:
- name: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tf_operator
  newName: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tf_operator
  newTag: v0.7.0
```
